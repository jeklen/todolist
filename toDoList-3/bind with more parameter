  I have a general question that I can't really find

  an answer to so hopefully you guys can help. I have a function that
  takes 3 parameters, below is an example of what I have.

def someFunction(self, event, string):

   do stuff ..

self.canvas.bind("<Button-1>", self.someFunction("Hello"))
When I run this, I get an error saying that I passed someFunction 2 arguments instead of 3. I'm not sure why ..

Here you're binding the result of someFunction (or trying to anyway). This fails because when python tries
to get the result of someFunction,
it calls it only passing 1 argument ("Hello") when someFunction really
expects 2 explicit arguments. You probably want something like:

self.canvas.bind('<Button-1>',lambda event: self.someFunction(event,"Hello"))
This binds a new function (which is created by lambda and wraps around self.someFunction) which
passes the correct arguments.
